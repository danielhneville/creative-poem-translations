# creative-poem-translations
Web app using the Collins Spanish-English dictionary API to enable creative translations of Spanish-language poetry. Users copy/paste a poem (and optionally its title) into a form. The Flask server parses the input into separate lines and words, then serves users a view in which they can click on individual words to get translations. Users type in their creative translations, then submit to view their translation side-by-side with the original poem.
